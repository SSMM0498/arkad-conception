Arkad is a modern, revolutionary web platform.

A new era of learning has begun! Welcome to Arkad.

Arkad is a web application that uses screen recording and coding interface.

Arkad allows you to create interactive tutorials by recording the keyboard and mouse actions in a video.

Those interactions allow the viewers of your tutorial to edit, run/test and share the code directly from video on the video in realtime.

Arkad enables you to add interactions into the videos you created, allowing your viewers to make changes to the source code, run them directly in their browsers, and share them with others.

Users can record their actions to create videos, and then Arkad saves the videos as live code that can be tested out immediately by your audience.

It provides you with ways to present your screen display in user friendly manner with recording made videos, creating notes/questions on the fly during the demonstration that the viewers of the tutorial may find valuable.

A live coding session can be hosted for your subscribers who can actively interact in your tutorial
